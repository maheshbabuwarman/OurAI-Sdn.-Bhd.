# Executive Summary

We applied the knowledge of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Internet of Things (IoT) into our everyday devices to make our life, smart. 
This project is focused on create a system by applying the concept of Internet of Things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) for home automation to improve the quality of life.
The scope of this project to apply Natural Language Processing, one of the applications of AI into the system to capture, 
interpret and execute action using owner’s voice command to perform home automation tasks.
The AI concept that will be used for the system is Natural Language Processing (NLP), and the reason is, 
we want to develop the machine in a way it could understand, analyse, manipulate, and 
generate the suitable response (action), based on the users’ voice command.
Generally, NLP is a branch of AI, where the main idea is to give computers the ability to read and 
comprehend the spoken and written words on the same way humans do, by analysing the grammatical structure of the sentence. 
The significance of this project is, we can control the light usage anywhere, and there’ll 
be no need to going back and forth to turn on/off the light in the house, especially when 
we are going out or going to sleep. One simple command is all it takes. 
In addition, we also added voice assistant feature into our system to make more interactive. 
Voice assistant is an intelligent personal assistant that are based on natural language speech recognition. 
They allow a search to be carried out using a voice command entered by the user, as well as information retrieval by voice synthesis.
